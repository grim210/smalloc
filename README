smalloc is small memory allocator for UNIX-like systems.  Its intended use is
to be embedded in other projects when the default memory allocator by the
operating system isn't up to the challange.

To use, you really only need to put the smalloc.c source file in your
project's source directory and the smalloc.h in your project's include
directory.  The CMake build system is there to assist in keeping smalloc's
test modules organized.

I'd love feedback!  And pull requests are even better.  Also, feel free to
open issues on the issue tracker.  This project has been released to the
public domain (see the LICENSE file), so feel free to use this code however
you like.
